## DESCRIPTION

Chrome Productivity Extension is a powerful and user-friendly Chrome extension built with React.js, designed to help users track and control the time they spend on various websites each day. In today’s digital world, distractions are just a click away, and it’s easy to lose track of time while browsing the internet. This extension helps bring awareness and structure to your online habits by automatically monitoring your web activity and giving you precise insights into how long you spend on each website. With a clean and responsive interface, users can view their daily time logs in real-time or analyze them later for productivity review. One of the standout features of this extension is the ability to set daily time limits for specific websites. Once the time limit is reached, the extension will trigger a popup alert, notifying you that your allotted time for that particular website has ended. After that, the website becomes inaccessible for the rest of the day, ensuring that you stick to your focus goals and avoid unnecessary distractions. This restriction is enforced directly in the browser, helping you stay committed to your time management plan without relying solely on willpower. Whether you're trying to reduce time on social media, limit your binge-watching, or make sure you’re focusing on studies or work tasks, this feature is a game-changer. In addition to automated tracking, the extension allows users to manually add or edit time entries, which is useful if you spent time on a task offline or want to make corrections. The tool is ideal for students, professionals, remote workers, and anyone interested in digital wellness. It promotes healthier screen time habits, increases productivity, and supports focused work sessions. Technically, the project demonstrates how React.js can be effectively used within a Chrome Extension environment, integrating with browser APIs, managing background scripts, and handling local storage to persist data between sessions. It is optimized for performance and designed to run smoothly without slowing down your browser. Furthermore, it respects user privacy by keeping all your time-tracking data stored locally—nothing is sent to external servers. The dashboard is simple, clear, and easy to use, showing how much time you’ve spent on each website along with any limits you’ve set. The interface helps you make data-driven decisions about your online behavior. Whether you're trying to build better habits, reclaim your focus, or just stay accountable, Website Time Tracker acts like a digital coach keeping you in check. With the added website-blocking functionality after time limits are reached, it doesn’t just inform—you get real consequences that support real change. It’s more than just a tracker; it’s a productivity tool that helps you take back control of your time and use the internet in a more intentional, meaningful way.
